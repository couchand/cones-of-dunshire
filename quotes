a brand new gaming experience

now the Ledgerman just keeps score

in order to get a cone you have to build a civilization

let me tell you about the Trivia Cards because you're gonna need to
know about Roadblocks first

then you roll three dice to see how many dice you roll with, oh 16,
perfect, lots of choices

the thing about the Challenge Play is that it's basically the game,
in reverse

[about the gold cone] obviously this would be much taller in the
real game

but the Corporal can veto

are the Cones a metaphor? well, yes and no

the Maverick should be able to trade Lumber for Agriculture Credits

there can't be an Alchemist of the Hinterlands, the Hinterlands are
a Shadow Kingdom that can only sustain a Provost or a Denier

play an Action Card: build a Belltower inside your Citadel

my Shaman cast a Toiber(?) spell on your Prosperity Tile. looks like
someone's out of Resource Gems

move my Abbot to the Ocean Hex which brings my Brinksman to the
Devil's Lair and pushes my Farmer, yes, my humble Farmer, directly
to the Central Cone
