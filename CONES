Cones of Dunshire
=================

and Sub-cones

My current working theory is that the large and medium sized cones
are the Cones of Dunshire and the smallest sized ones are the
Sub-cones.  I'm also going on the assumption that there are similar
numbers of cones in each color except gold, since the staging of the
game board seems to suggest that.

That implies that the 21 Cones of Dunshire are composed of:

 - 1 gold large
 - 2 black large
 - 2 black medium
 - 2 red large
 - 2 red medium
 - 2 yellow large
 - 2 yellow medium
 - 2 green large
 - 2 green medium
 - 2 blue large
 - 2 blue medium

And the 15 Sub-cones are:

 - 3 black small
 - 3 red small
 - 3 yellow small
 - 3 green small
 - 3 blue small.

This also suggests that the colors are not associated with a
particular player, unless only certain player roles are given cones.
We can reasonably exclude the Ledgerman.  If we also exclude the
Arbiter, we need only exclude one more role from coneage, possibly
the Corporal or the Second Warrior.

One other curiousity: on occasion the gold cone is seen atop one of
the others, usually a large black.  It is not known if this is just
how they're stored or if it has game significance, and if so, whether
the gold cone can rest on other colors or only on black.

These are the positively identified cones:
