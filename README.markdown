Cones of Dunshire
=================

*Determining the Rules of Play*

Cones of Dunshire is a complex German-style board game invented by
Ben Wyatt on the TV show Parks and Recreation.  Some of the rules are
described in great detail on the show, and there is a shot of the
first page of the rulebook as well.  Let's see how much we can
figure out from canon clues.

**N.B.** Behind the scenes the game was designed by Mayfair Games,
who have announced they will release a version this August.  So this
project is a race against the clock!
